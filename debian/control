Description: push a new Docker image only if changed
 docker-push-latest-if-changed compares a new Docker image to an old one,
 comparing installed system packages and commands run to generate the image.
 .
 It will only push a new image if it detects a real change. This helps reduce
 the cost of rebuilding base images frequently; you can build them often but
 only push when necessary. Without this tool, every build of the base image
 would require all downstream images to also rebuild.
